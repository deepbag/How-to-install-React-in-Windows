# How-to-install-React-in-Windows
In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to how you ca install react in window from scratch. We'll make use of the create-react-app CLI tool to quickly generate a React Project.

## Step 1: Install Node.js
The first step is to download the Node.js installer for Windows. Letâ€™s use the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version for Windows and choose the 32-bit 64-bit version, using the Windows Installer icon: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blanck">Download</a>

Once downloaded, we run the Node.js installer complete the installation.

## Step 2: Open a Command Prompt in Windows
Install Create-React-App package to simplify the process of creating and installing React into your projects.
type in the following command : 
> npm install -g create-react-app

## Note:
> When using create-react-app ensure you are in the desired directory/folder location as this command will create the project folder in the current path.

## Command for creating project:
> create-react-app your-project-name

The entire process is automated and begins with creating a new React app folder for the project, then installs packages and dependencies. The default packages include react, react-dom, and react-scripts. The installation will take a few minutes.

## Run a React Project Application:
To run our new project, we need to use the command prompt to change to the project folder, then start it. The cd your-project-name command will take us to the your-project-name
> cd reactproject2 
## The npm start command will run the project application:
> npm start
